In several cases the implementation of some higher levels features might as
well be in Python. Fortunately we can attach Python methods to C++ class
bindings after the fact.

We can also move the implementation to C++ if desired.

    """Attach methods of a Python support class to an existing class

    This monkeypatches all methods defined in the support class onto an
    existing class. Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        @augments(ClassDefinedInCpp)
        class SupportClass:
            def foo(self):
                pass

    The Python method 'foo' will be monkeypatched on ClassDefinedInCpp. SupportClass
    has no meaning on its own and should not be used, but gets returned from
    this function so IDE code inspection doesn't get too confused.

    We don't subclass because it's much more convenient to monkeypatch Python
    methods onto the existing Python binding of the C++ class. For one thing,
    this allows the implementation to be moved from Python to C++ or vice
    versa. It saves having to implement an intermediate Python subclass and then
    ensures that the C++ superclass never 'leaks' to pikepdf users. Finally,
    wrapper classes and subclasses can become problematic if the call stack
    crosses the C++/Python boundary multiple times.

    Any existing methods may be used, regardless of whether they defined
    elsewhere in the support class or in the target class.

    The target class does not have to be C++ or derived from pybind11.
