    The idea is to decouple the place to save to from the process used
    to dump the content.
    We are saving several objects such as patterns and SVGs.
    They should all have the same convenient interface.

    The process of saving something usually requires writing to some file.
    However, users may want to have the result as a string, an open file,
    a file on the hard drive on a fixed or temporary location,
    posted to some url or in a zip file.
    This class should provide for all those needs while providing a uniform
    interface for the dumping.
